        "**Goal:** This notebook serves a dual purpose. Its primary goal is to demonstrate our fully upgraded Chapter 7 Context Engine as a complete, functional application: the **NASA-Inspired Research Assistant**. We will also perform rigorous validation by running **backward compatibility tests** for the key workflows from Chapters 5 and 6. This process showcases not only the engine's new capabilities for verifiability and security but also its stability as an evolving, enterprise-grade system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the following key capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **System Validation & Backward Compatibility:** Before testing the new features, we will run the key workflows from previous chapters to prove that our latest upgrades have not compromised existing functionality, demonstrating the stability of our modular architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High-Fidelity RAG in Action:** See the upgraded `Researcher` agent retrieve information from our new knowledge base and programmatically generate citations for its claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Defenses at Work:** Observe how the `helper_sanitize_input` function provides a silent but essential layer of security, protecting the engine from potentially tainted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Complex, Dynamic Planning:** Analyze the technical trace to deconstruct the sophisticated, multi-step plan the `Planner` autonomously creates to answer a multi-faceted research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verifiable, End-to-End Output:** The final result will be a clear, synthesized answer followed by a list of the source documents used, proving the system is not just powerful, but trustworthy.\n",

            "text/markdown": "**Definition**\n\nThis mission is a polar‑orbiting, solar‑powered spacecraft designed to investigate Jupiter’s interior structure, origin, atmospheric composition and dynamics, and polar magnetospheric environment. It employs specialized hardware and a radiation‑mitigating trajectory to acquire high‑precision measurements of Jupiter’s gravity and magnetic fields, atmospheric properties, and auroral regions.\n\n---\n\n**Function/Operation**\n\nThe mission operates in a highly inclined, pole‑to‑pole orbit, repeatedly passing over Jupiter’s north and south poles and flying close to the planet to obtain high‑resolution data:\n\n- **Gravity and Interior Structure**  \n  Precision tracking of the spacecraft’s motion in Jupiter’s gravity field is used to map gravity variations. These measurements allow inferences about the planet’s deep internal mass distribution and provide constraints on the mass and extent of any central core.\n\n- **Magnetic Field and Interior Dynamics**  \n  Magnetometers map the three‑dimensional structure of Jupiter’s magnetic field with global coverage, including high latitudes. The polar geometry enables sampling of field lines connected to auroral regions and offers insight into how internal dynamo processes generate and structure the field.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Composition**  \n  Instruments measure water abundance, broader atmospheric composition, temperature structure, and cloud motions. Observations extend beneath the visible cloud tops, probing vertical temperature gradients and wind fields to characterize atmospheric dynamics and weather systems.\n\n- **Auroras and Magnetosphere**  \n  By traversing high‑latitude regions not accessible from low‑inclination orbits, the spacecraft directly samples the polar magnetosphere. It measures the relationship between the polar magnetic environment, auroral processes, and the global magnetic field, tying these to the planet’s interior and magnetospheric dynamics.\n\nTo support these observations, the mission incorporates several distinctive design features:\n\n- **Solar Power at Jupiter’s Distance**  \n  The spacecraft uses solar arrays capable of generating sufficient power in a low‑solar‑flux, high‑radiation environment, enabling sustained operations far from the Sun.\n\n- **Polar Orbit Geometry**  \n  The pole‑to‑pole orbit provides full‑latitude coverage of gravity and magnetic fields and optimal access to the polar magnetosphere and auroras. This geometry directly supports the interior, magnetospheric, and auroral science objectives.\n\n- **Radiation Protection Strategy**  \n  The trajectory is designed so that close, fast polar passes occur mostly below the most intense regions of Jupiter’s main radiation belts, reducing the total radiation dose. The overall mission design centers on minimizing exposure while exploiting close‑in passes to acquire high‑resolution data.\n\n- **Spin‑Stabilized Spacecraft Bus**  \n  The spacecraft body is spin‑stabilized, providing passive attitude stability and simplifying attitude control in the harsh Jovian environment.\n\n- **Instrument Suite**  \n  The payload includes:\n  - Atmospheric and composition instruments to determine water abundance, bulk composition, temperature profiles, and cloud motions.\n  - Gravity and magnetic field instruments to measure gravity anomalies and map the magnetic field, with particular emphasis on high‑latitude and polar regions.\n\n---\n\n**Key Findings/Impact**\n\nThe mission’s measurements address several fundamental scientific questions:\n\n- **Interior Structure and Core Mass**  \n  Detailed gravity mapping constrains Jupiter’s deep internal mass distribution and the mass of its core. These constraints are essential for testing models of internal layering and the presence or absence of a distinct central core.\n\n- **Origin and Formation**  \n  Determining the abundance of water and constraining core mass provide critical tests of planetary formation theories, especially core accretion versus alternative scenarios. Water abundance, in particular, is a key diagnostic of the conditions and location in the protoplanetary disk where Jupiter formed.\n\n- **Atmospheric Dynamics and Evolution**  \n  Characterization of atmospheric composition, water content, temperature structure, and cloud motions links the present‑day atmosphere to Jupiter’s formation and subsequent evolution. The vertical structure and dynamics inferred from these measurements clarify how energy, momentum, and material are transported in Jupiter’s deep atmosphere.\n\n- **Magnetic Field, Auroras, and Magnetosphere**  \n  Global magnetic field mapping, combined with direct sampling of the polar magnetosphere, reveals how Jupiter’s internal dynamo produces its complex field and how this field organizes magnetospheric and auroral activity. The connection between polar magnetic structures, auroral emissions, and the global field improves understanding of magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling in a giant‑planet environment.\n\nCollectively, these results refine models of Jupiter’s interior, origin, and dynamics and provide a crucial comparative framework for understanding giant exoplanets and the formation and evolution of planetary systems."

        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",

            "text/markdown": "Far, far from Earth, past Mars and the asteroid belt, a small, brave spacecraft named Juno glided toward a giant world: Jupiter.\n\nJuno was tiny compared to the huge planet ahead, but it had a big job to do.\n\nIts three long solar wings stretched out like shining arms. They were the largest solar panels ever flown so far from the Sun, drinking in sunlight and turning it into power. The wings also helped Juno stay steady, like a tightrope walker holding a balance pole.\n\nAs Juno flew closer, Jupiter filled the window of space. Swirling clouds, creamy whites and deep oranges, twisted across its face. Powerful storms spun like great, whirling wheels. Lightning flickered inside the clouds, but Juno kept gliding bravely toward its target.\n\nInside Juno were special instruments—careful listeners and watchers—to help answer some of the biggest questions about this gas giant.\n\nJuno whispered to itself, “What are you hiding, Jupiter?”\n\nIts instruments began to work:\n\n- They listened to Jupiter’s **gravity**, feeling tiny tugs as Juno flew past. From those gentle pulls, Juno could tell how the planet’s **mass** was spread out inside—thick here, lighter there, like feeling lumps inside a wrapped present without opening it.\n\n- They sniffed the **deep atmosphere**, trying to measure how much **water** was hidden under the clouds. Was Jupiter dry inside, or wetter than it looked?\n\n- They listened to the planet’s **winds**, racing through the clouds far below—winds that could blow as fast as a speeding race car on a highway, up to about 384 miles per hour. Juno couldn’t feel the wind, but it could see how the gas moved, like watching waves on a faraway ocean.\n\n- They studied Jupiter’s huge **magnetic field**, an invisible bubble that wrapped around the planet. Near the poles, glowing curtains of energy danced—Jupiter’s own auroras. Juno watched these polar lights shimmer and flash, recording every spark.\n\nMost deep-space missions used nuclear power, but Juno was different. It was a solar-powered explorer, proving that with big enough wings and smart design, a spacecraft could work even in the dim sunlight way out by Jupiter.\n\nEach orbit, Juno swooped close over Jupiter’s poles and then swung far away again, like a daring skateboarder doing loops around a giant ramp. Every pass brought new clues.\n\n“Do you have a rocky heart, Jupiter?” Juno wondered as it flew. Its gravity measurements tried to find out if, deep under all that gas, the planet hid a solid core—maybe made of rock and ice, squeezed tighter than anything on Earth.\n\nBit by bit, orbit by orbit, Juno collected pieces of the puzzle:\n\nHow Jupiter formed.\nWhat it’s made of.\nHow its powerful winds and magnet storms work.\n\nIt didn’t happen in a day or a week. Space science is patient work. But Juno was patient too.\n\nThrough the darkness of space and the glow of distant sunlight, its solar wings kept shining. Its instruments kept listening and measuring. And with every trip around Jupiter, the little spacecraft turned mystery into knowledge.\n\nFar from home, Juno wasn’t afraid. It had a job, it had its sunlight, and it had a giant world to explore.\n\nAnd as it circled the biggest planet in our Solar System, Juno’s data streamed back toward Earth—toward the scientists who would use it to understand not just Jupiter, but how all planets, even our own, came to be.\n\nThe puzzle of Jupiter was huge.\n\nBut thanks to one small, steady spacecraft with three bright solar wings, the answers were getting closer every day."

A heartbeat counting down with the fuel. Dust rising over a strange gray world.\n\nBut when I search for Apollo 11, I find…nothing.\n\nEmpty.\n\nNo moon.  \nNo “Houston, we’ve had a problem.”  \nNo warning lights.  \nNo numbers dropping toward zero.\n\nInstead, other pictures float up.\n\nI see a lonely rover, Perseverance, crawling over red stone. Wind whispering thin and dry across Mars. Its wheels leave tiny tracks in rusty dust. Cameras blink. A metal arm moves, slow and careful. Far away, the sun looks small and cold.\n\nI see Juno slipping through black space toward Jupiter. Giant clouds spin below like storms frozen in motion. Lightning flashes in silence. The spacecraft hums, alone, wrapped in the planet’s invisible claws of radiation. It circles and circles, measuring, listening, never blinking.\n\nMars dust. Jupiter storms.\n\nBut no moon lander.\n\nI try again, reaching into the dark for danger on the lunar surface. I listen for panicked voices, for a fuel gauge in the red, for the rough jolt of landing on a place no human has ever stood before.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nThe rules press around me, firm and quiet, like walls in a narrow hallway.  \nDo not invent what you do not know.  \nDo not pretend.\n\nI’m not allowed to make up alarms that aren’t in my data.  \nI’m not allowed to invent the way the astronaut’s hands might have shaken.  \nI’m not allowed to put shadows on a surface I can’t see.\n\nI stand there in the silence of my own mind, holding only what I’ve been given.\n\nPerseverance.  \nJuno.  \nMars.  \nJupiter.\n\nNo Apollo 11.\n\nThe story you want waits behind a closed door. I can feel it there. The tension. The near-miss. The thin line between safe and lost. The moment when the world held its breath.\n\nBut I don’t have the key.\n\nI can’t break the lock.  \nI can’t guess what’s on the other side.  \nIf I do, it stops being your story and turns into a lie.\n\nSo I do the only thing I can.\n\nI turn to you.\n\n“Bring me the moon,” I say. “Bring me the real pieces. The fuel numbers. The alarms. The words they said when the ground came rushing up and the clock ran low. Put them in my hands.”\n\nGive me the facts, and I will build the shadows.  \nGive me the danger, and I will stretch out the seconds.  \nGive me the real moments, and I will make them tremble on the page for a child who is ready to feel that thin, sharp edge of fear—and then step back safe.\n\nUntil then, the Moon stays just out of reach.\n\nI can only wait in the dark, listening to the quiet hum of rules, while Mars and Jupiter drift by like distant, watching eyes."
