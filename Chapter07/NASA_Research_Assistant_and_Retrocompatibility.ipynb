        "**Goal:** This notebook serves a dual purpose. Its primary goal is to demonstrate our fully upgraded Chapter 7 Context Engine as a complete, functional application: the **NASA-Inspired Research Assistant**. We will also perform rigorous validation by running **backward compatibility tests** for the key workflows from Chapters 5 and 6. This process showcases not only the engine's new capabilities for verifiability and security but also its stability as an evolving, enterprise-grade system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the following key capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **System Validation & Backward Compatibility:** Before testing the new features, we will run the key workflows from previous chapters to prove that our latest upgrades have not compromised existing functionality, demonstrating the stability of our modular architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High-Fidelity RAG in Action:** See the upgraded `Researcher` agent retrieve information from our new knowledge base and programmatically generate citations for its claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Defenses at Work:** Observe how the `helper_sanitize_input` function provides a silent but essential layer of security, protecting the engine from potentially tainted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Complex, Dynamic Planning:** Analyze the technical trace to deconstruct the sophisticated, multi-step plan the `Planner` autonomously creates to answer a multi-faceted research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verifiable, End-to-End Output:** The final result will be a clear, synthesized answer followed by a list of the source documents used, proving the system is not just powerful, but trustworthy."

Its primary scientific objectives include quantifying Jupiter’s water abundance, constraining its core mass, characterizing atmospheric composition and dynamics, mapping gravity and magnetic fields, and investigating the polar magnetosphere and auroral regions.\n\nFunction/Operation\n- Polar orbital coverage: Juno is the first mission to orbit an outer planet from pole to pole, enabling global observations that include direct access to high-latitude auroral and magnetospheric regions.\n- Radiation-avoidance trajectory: The spacecraft flies below Jupiter’s most intense radiation belts during close passes, reducing radiation exposure while enabling high-precision, close-in measurements needed for gravity and magnetic-field mapping and probing the planet’s deep interior.\n- Measurement focus: The mission conducts remote and in situ observations to determine atmospheric composition and temperature, track cloud motions, and map the structure of the interior via gravity and magnetic signatures, while exploring how the polar magnetosphere operates.\n\nKey Findings/Impact\n- Formation constraints: By measuring water abundance and constraining core mass, Juno provides decisive tests of competing giant-planet formation theories and clarifies conditions in the early Solar System.\n- System-level understanding: Comprehensive atmospheric, interior, and magnetospheric observations improve models of how Jupiter functions as a system, especially at high latitudes.\n- Exoplanet relevance: As Jupiter is the archetype of giant planets, Juno’s results strengthen the interpretation of giant exoplanets and their formation pathways."

        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",

How did this world form? Is there a rocky heart? Is there water buried deep? How is its mass stacked, layer by secret layer? I listen for answers in tiny pulls and faint tones.\n\nThe winds below are fast. 618 kilometers per hour. They twist in bands I cannot see, but I feel their story in the data. The planet breathes in storms.\n\nThree wings hold me steady. Enormous. The largest ever on a planetary probe. Sunlight runs along their edges. They keep me balanced as I dive and rise.\n\nI am the second to linger here. Galileo came first. It watched from 1995 to 2003. Then silence. I launched in 2011 and followed the long arc in. I finished my first promise. I was asked to stay. I said yes.\n\nThe giant waits beneath me. Old. Patient. Its magnetic poles hiss. Its gravity reaches up like a question.\n\nI descend again. Instruments open. Readings tick. The auroras flicker like curtains. The dark swallows my shadow.\n\nI ask my questions. The planet does not answer. Not yet. But it trembles the line. And I hear it."
