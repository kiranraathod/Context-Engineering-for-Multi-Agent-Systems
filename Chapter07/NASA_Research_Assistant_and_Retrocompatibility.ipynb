        "**Goal:** This notebook serves a dual purpose. Its primary goal is to demonstrate our fully upgraded Chapter 7 Context Engine as a complete, functional application: the **NASA-Inspired Research Assistant**. We will also perform rigorous validation by running **backward compatibility tests** for the key workflows from Chapters 5 and 6. This process showcases not only the engine's new capabilities for verifiability and security but also its stability as an evolving, enterprise-grade system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the following key capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **System Validation & Backward Compatibility:** Before testing the new features, we will run the key workflows from previous chapters to prove that our latest upgrades have not compromised existing functionality, demonstrating the stability of our modular architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High-Fidelity RAG in Action:** See the upgraded `Researcher` agent retrieve information from our new knowledge base and programmatically generate citations for its claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Defenses at Work:** Observe how the `helper_sanitize_input` function provides a silent but essential layer of security, protecting the engine from potentially tainted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Complex, Dynamic Planning:** Analyze the technical trace to deconstruct the sophisticated, multi-step plan the `Planner` autonomously creates to answer a multi-faceted research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verifiable, End-to-End Output:** The final result will be a clear, synthesized answer followed by a list of the source documents used, proving the system is not just powerful, but trustworthy."

        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",
