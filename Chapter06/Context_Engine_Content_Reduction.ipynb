        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",

Bands fade and glow. The Great Red Spot rolls by, slow as a breath. The airless dark crackles. I hear it in the radio hiss. The polar magnetosphere sizzles like static.\n\nI aim for the top. A polar orbit. Over the north. Down the south. Around and around.\n\nI listen with metal ears. I measure composition. I feel gravity tug and weigh it. I trace the magnetic field, thread by thread. I sample the polar magnetosphere, bright with auroras.\n\nI hunt for clues. A rocky core, hidden deep. Water, tucked in clouds. Mass distribution, secret and heavy. Deep winds, turning in the dark.\n\nJupiter waits. Huge. Cold. Its pull is the Source. Its storms whisper. Come closer.\n\nEngines ready. Not yet. Hold. Shadows creep across my decks. The panels creak. Numbers tick. The clock blinks.\n\nNow.\n\nFlame. A steady roar. The craft shivers. Gravity clutches. I do not wobble. My wings keep me true.\n\nSensors sing. Data pours like rain.\n\nThe roar softens. The pull evens. A quiet click.\n\nI slip into a tight polar path.\n\nOrbit. Safe. Triumphant."
