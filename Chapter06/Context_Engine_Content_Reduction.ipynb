        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",

These arrays:\n  - Generate all of the spacecraft’s **electrical power**.\n  - Help **stabilize** the spacecraft in flight due to their size and configuration.\n\n- Unlike most missions to the outer Solar System, which rely on **radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)**, Juno runs entirely on **solar power**, demonstrating that solar technology can support operations even at Jupiter’s great distance from the Sun."
